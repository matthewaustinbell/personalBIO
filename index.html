                Working for my self as a musician in nashville was aspirational to say the least,
                but in under a year of moving to nashville it was a reality. Although it was a just paying the rent 
                and the grocery bill reality, a reality none the less. I wanted to have impact. I remember telling someone, 
                I bet it was great to have been a farmer, but what about the guy who invented the pitch fork? He seemingly changed so many peoples lives 
                by scratching his own itch. One day, finding my self at a music and business conference some years later, i saw people that were creating things using technology 
                that impacted so many.
